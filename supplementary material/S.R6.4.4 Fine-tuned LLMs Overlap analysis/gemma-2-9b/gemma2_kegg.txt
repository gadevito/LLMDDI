Interpretation
- This section interprets the overlap and subgroup metrics to assess potential leakage and true generalization.
- No pair overlap detected (ordered or unordered). Pair-level leakage is unlikely.
- Entity overlap distribution: none=5594 (42.2%), one=6001 (45.2%), both=1667 (12.6%).
- Entity generalization: NO_ENTITY_OVERLAP F1=0.772 vs TWO_ENTITY_OVERLAP F1=0.824 (0.052 lower).
- Pair memorization (unordered): NO_UNORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.803 vs EXACT_UNORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.000 (0.803 higher).
- Pair memorization (ordered): NO_ORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.803 vs EXACT_ORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.000 (0.803 higher).
  Interpretation: No unordered-pair overlaps; pair-level leakage (as a set) is unlikely.
- Both-known-but-new-pair F1=0.824.
  Interpretation: Good compositional generalization: when both drugs are known but combined in a new pair, performance remains strong.
