Interpretation
- This section interprets the overlap and subgroup metrics to assess potential leakage and true generalization.
- No pair overlap detected (ordered or unordered). Pair-level leakage is unlikely.
- Entity overlap distribution: none=70 (47.3%), one=66 (44.6%), both=12 (8.1%).
- Entity generalization: NO_ENTITY_OVERLAP F1=0.727 vs TWO_ENTITY_OVERLAP F1=0.952 (0.225 lower).
- Pair memorization (unordered): NO_UNORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.870 vs EXACT_UNORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.000 (0.870 higher).
- Pair memorization (ordered): NO_ORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.870 vs EXACT_ORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.000 (0.870 higher).
  Interpretation: Much higher F1 when both entities are known than when both are new suggests reliance on entity familiarity; consider an entity-disjoint evaluation.
  Interpretation: No unordered-pair overlaps; pair-level leakage (as a set) is unlikely.
- Both-known-but-new-pair F1=0.952.
  Interpretation: Good compositional generalization: when both drugs are known but combined in a new pair, performance remains strong.
Recommended actions:
- report subgroup metrics (entity-disjoint vs entity-overlap) in the paper to transparently address memorization concerns.
