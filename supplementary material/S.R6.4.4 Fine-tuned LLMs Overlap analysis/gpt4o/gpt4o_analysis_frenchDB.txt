Interpretation
- This section interprets the overlap and subgroup metrics to assess potential leakage and true generalization.
- No pair overlap detected (ordered or unordered). Pair-level leakage is unlikely.
- Entity overlap distribution: none=3788 (44.1%), one=3875 (45.1%), both=931 (10.8%).
- Entity generalization: NO_ENTITY_OVERLAP F1=0.941 vs TWO_ENTITY_OVERLAP F1=0.965 (0.024 lower).
- Pair memorization (unordered): NO_UNORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.949 vs EXACT_UNORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.000 (0.949 higher).
- Pair memorization (ordered): NO_ORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.949 vs EXACT_ORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.000 (0.949 higher).
  Interpretation: F1 on completely new entities is close to overall F1; model shows true entity-level generalization.
  Interpretation: No unordered-pair overlaps; pair-level leakage (as a set) is unlikely.
- Both-known-but-new-pair F1=0.965.
  Interpretation: Good compositional generalization: when both drugs are known but combined in a new pair, performance remains strong.
