Interpretation
- This section interprets the overlap and subgroup metrics to assess potential leakage and true generalization.
- No pair overlap detected (ordered or unordered). Pair-level leakage is unlikely.
- Entity overlap distribution: none=1281 (42.3%), one=1255 (41.5%), both=490 (16.2%).
- Entity generalization: NO_ENTITY_OVERLAP F1=0.831 vs TWO_ENTITY_OVERLAP F1=0.723 (0.108 higher).
- Pair memorization (unordered): NO_UNORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.873 vs EXACT_UNORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.000 (0.873 higher).
- Pair memorization (ordered): NO_ORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.873 vs EXACT_ORDERED_PAIR_OVERLAP F1=0.000 (0.873 higher).
  Interpretation: No unordered-pair overlaps; pair-level leakage (as a set) is unlikely.
- Both-known-but-new-pair F1=0.723.
  Interpretation: Good compositional generalization: when both drugs are known but combined in a new pair, performance remains strong.
